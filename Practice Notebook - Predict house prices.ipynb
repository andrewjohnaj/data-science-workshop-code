    "# Getting Started\n",
    "In this project, we will evaluate the performance and predictive power of a model that has been trained and tested on data collected from homes in suburbs of Boston, Massachusetts. A model trained on this data that is seen as a good fit could then be used to make certain predictions about a home â€” in particular, its monetary value. This model would prove to be invaluable for someone like a real estate agent who could make use of such information on a daily basis."

    "\n",
    "We are using three features from the Boston housing dataset: 'RM', 'LSTAT', and 'PTRATIO'. For each data point (neighborhood):\n",
    "\n",
    "'RM' is the average number of rooms among homes in the neighborhood.\n",
    "'LSTAT' is the percentage of homeowners in the neighborhood considered \"lower class\" (working poor).\n",
    "'PTRATIO' is the ratio of students to teachers in primary and secondary schools in the neighborhood.\n",
    "\n",
    "MEDV gives the price\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Clean the data\n",
    "2. Calculate the minimum, maximum, mean, median, and standard deviation of 'MEDV', which is stored in prices. Store each calculation in their respective variable.\n",
    "3. Explore the data and plot the trends. Write a summary of your observation.\n",
    "4. Machine Learning! Create a model to predict the prices"
